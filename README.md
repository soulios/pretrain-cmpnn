# pretrain-cmpnn
This code is an attempt to bind two previous established methods, namely a GNN and DGI or masking, in order to predict the toxicity of chemicals.

- The Communicative Message Passing Neural Network (CMPNN) can be found in this GitHub repository: [CMPNN GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SY575/CMPNN)
- The pretraining strategies like masking and DGI are publicly available here: [Pretrain-GNNs GitHub Repository](https://github.com/snap-stanford/pretrain-gnns)
